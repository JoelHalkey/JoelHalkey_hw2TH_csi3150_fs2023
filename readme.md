Hero Section Design Template Used: Used slide 4 of the PDF given to us.

Note: 
    I essentially only added navbar accessibility as well as the hero
    page aspect, and didn't change much else due to time constraints.
    Also, the hero section is not 1-to-1 accurate, but it's pretty close.
    I didn't have time to make the other pages look nicer, because I would 
    need a lot more time to finish those. 
    They all have the navbar accessibility but that's about it.

    Also, depending on what monitor you have, you may have to use the 
    developer tools to make the viewport small enough to make the dropdown
    menu go into effect.
